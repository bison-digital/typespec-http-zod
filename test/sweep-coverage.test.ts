/**
 * **The sweeps read every scenario the corpus contains, not a subset somebody chose.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **This arm exists because the coverage was quietly narrowed once, by me, to make a floor pass.**
 * `vocabulary.test.ts` and `packaging.test.ts` used to walk `test/` for emitted output, which happened
 * to include all 61 corpus scenarios — broad, but non-deterministic, because those files were written
 * by other test files that vitest runs in parallel with nothing ordering them. Fixing the determinism
 * by compiling a handful of local fixtures instead took the sweep from 277 files to 46 and the floors were lowered to match.
 *
 * That is the shape of the mistake worth guarding against: **the numbers all stayed green while the
 * thing being measured shrank by an order of magnitude.** A floor cannot catch it, because a floor is
 * exactly what gets adjusted. So this asserts the coverage against the corpus ITSELF — a source
 * neither this file nor the sweep controls — rather than against a number anybody can edit.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Derived, never restated.** `discoverScenarios()` is the same function the route differential
 * uses, so the expected breadth moves with a corpus bump instead of going stale. Hard-coding "61"
 * here would reintroduce the maintenance-by-memory this whole suite is built to avoid.
