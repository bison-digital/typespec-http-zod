 * does, and the failure is silent — the reader concludes the emitter has no opinion about the thing
 * that just refused their spec.
 *
 * So a diagnostic or an option added later fails this suite until it is written down. That is the
 * whole mechanism: the cost of documenting is paid at the moment the capability is added, by the
