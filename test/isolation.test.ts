/**
 * **No two test files may compile into the same output directory.**
 *
 * **This is the failure that looks exactly like a flaky emitter, and it has now happened twice.**
 * Vitest runs test files in parallel. Two files compiling one fixture into one directory with
 * different options overwrite each other, so whichever finishes last decides what the other is
 * asserting against. The first occurrence made the same request answer 400, 200 and 204 across three
 * runs of an unchanged emitter. The second was still live when this guard was written:
 * `emit.test.ts` and `reference/reference.test.ts` both compiled `service` into
 * `test/reference/.out/service/`, and on a populated tree `emit.test.ts` failed with four `TS2305`s
 * against a `schemas.gen.ts` that a different suite had written under different options.
 *
 * **A comment warning about it was not enough** - `FixtureOptions.outName` already carried that
 * exact warning, and `acceptance.test.ts` already used it correctly. The rule was known, written
 * down, and applied inconsistently, which is what a guard is for and a docblock is not.
 *
 * **The class, not a list of members.** Every `compileFixture` call site in the package is read, its
 * destination derived the way `compileFixture` derives it, and any destination claimed by more than
 * one test file is named. Adding a suite that collides fails here rather than intermittently
 * somewhere else.
