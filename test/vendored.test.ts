 * the failure is silent: each suite passes against its own copy while the two specs describe
 * different services, so "both packages agree about the reference service" quietly stops being true.
 *
 * The digest lives in `PROVENANCE.md` beside the file — the same treatment this codebase already gives
 * vendored reference documents, which are committed with provenance and never fetched, because a
 * suite that reaches the network decides its own result on a value it did not supply.
