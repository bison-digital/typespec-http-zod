 * package resolves its own devDependencies, so a source file importing something it never declared
 * works perfectly — right up until somebody installs it on its own and gets `Cannot find package`.
 * Measured before an arm like this existed: the emitter imported `resolveOperationId` from
 * `@typespec/openapi`, which appeared in `devDependencies` and in no `peerDependencies` at all. The
 * published package would not have run.
 *
 * The generated OUTPUT has the same problem one level out: it imports `zod` into the consumer's
 * project, so that is the consumer's requirement too, and saying so is this manifest's job.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Asserted as a CLASS** — every specifier the source and the output reference — rather than as a
 * list somebody remembers to extend.
